## RUNNER

### discard stderr/stdout

This is an option to not allow stdout/stderr to be loged,
so if discard is set as string before running the command the stdout/stderr should be redirected,
to /dev/null.

## Reload Configuration

Need to do reload configuration, check github issue for more information.

## Start & stop program from cmdline.

If programs are not in `autostart_map` we can start them with "start", "stop" with command line follow by the program name,

Create other program in yaml for testing if start work properly.
